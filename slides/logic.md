## Formal Logic

<br>
<br>

The abstract study of propositions, statements, or assertively used sentences and of deductive arguments.


Notes:

For millenia human's have been devising formal, rigorous systems of reasoning deduction and proofs.

## Propositional Logic
<br>
A systematic method of interpreting series of **propositions**, evaluating them and decucing a conclusion.

+++

Propositions are statements which could be **true** or **false**

 * It's raining
 * The sky is blue

+++

logical **arguments** are formed by taking one or more **propositions** as **premises** and an aditional proposition as the **conclusion** 

+++

If it is raining, then it's cloudy.

It is raining.

Therefore, it's cloudy.


Note: 

This argument consists of 2 premesis and the conclusion

Normally this would be translated into a mathematical notation, for brevity

+++

The **premises** are assumed to be **true**

+++

We can then choose from a variety of inference rules and deduce the conclusion

+++


>P implies Q and P is asserted to be true, therefore Q must be true.

(Modus ponens)

+++

let **P** = "It's raining"

let **Q** = "It's Cloudy"

+++

If it is raining (**P**), then it is cloudy (**Q**)

_**P** implies **Q**_

`P -> Q`

+++

It is raining (**P**)

`P`

+++

>P implies Q and P is asserted to be true, therefore Q must be true.


Therefore, it's cloudy.

+++

Mathematical framework for working with logic in the form of propositions.

## Predicate Logic

Introducing Predicates

+++ 

Predicates differ from propostions 
 Introduces inferential rules for

+++

More powerful propositions, in the form of predicates.

+++

Let `$s$` be simon


Let `$Hx$` be the predicate, `$x$` is `$H$`uman

+++

>Simon is human

`$Hs$`

+++

More than one variable

Prefix notation

+++

>The englishman lives in the red house

Let `$e$` = the engilish man

Let `$r$`  =  the red house

Let `$Lxy$`  be the predicate, `$x$` `$L$`ives in `$y$`
 
+++

>The englishman lives in the red house

`$$Ler$$`

+++

Predicates, are themselves a proposition from which we can build arguments

+++

`$$Hs$$`

+++
